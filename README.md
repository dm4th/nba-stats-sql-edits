# NBA Stats SQL Generator

### Setup

Before running anything, make sure you have:
1. Installed all dependencies in `requirements.txt
2. Downloaded the nba.sqlite database to the root directory
3. Created a .env file with the same structure as .env.example


## Testing with main.py

If you want to jsut give the repo a test drive, run your prompts through main.py. It's just a quick CLI that will return the SQL that Claude generates given your prompt and the NBA database query result. You can see that it's still a bit rudimentary for more complex queries, but it should get a decent chunk of the answers correct.

## Following Work in notebook.py

I tried to show most of my work in getting to an answer in notebook.py. You can also follow along how I created the test suite and evaluted my performance in the video linked below.
